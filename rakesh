To modify your shell script for a successful execution and generate a summary of created and copied files, you can implement logging and summary generation at the end of the script. Here's a revised version of your script with the required changes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <SID>"
    exit 1
fi

# Variables
SID=$1
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
TAR_DIR="/sap_mig/$SID/$HOSTNAME"
LOG_FILE="$TAR_DIR/sap_mig_$SID/log_$HOSTNAME_$TIMESTAMP.log"
ERROR_LOG="$TAR_DIR/sap_mig_$SID/error_log_$HOSTNAME_$TIMESTAMP.log"
SUMMARY_FILE="$TAR_DIR/summary_$HOSTNAME_$TIMESTAMP.log"

mkdir -p "$TAR_DIR"

# Function to log progress
log_message() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') INFO: $1" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to log errors
log_error() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') ERROR: $1" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE" "$ERROR_LOG"
}

# Function to execute a command and handle its success or failure
execute_with_log() {
    local description="$1"
    local command="$2"

    log_message "START: $description"
    eval "$command"
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        log_message "SUCCESS: $description" | tee -a "$SUMMARY_FILE"
    else
        log_error "FAILURE: $description"
    fi
}

log_message "Script started for SID: $SID."

# Create folder structures
execute_with_log "Create directory structure at $TAR_DIR" "mkdir -p $TAR_DIR/TAR $TAR_DIR/etc"

# TAR commands
log_message "Starting tarball operations."

execute_with_log "Creating tarball for /usr/sap/$SID" "nohup tar -czvf $TAR_DIR/TAR/$SID.tar.gz /usr/sap/$SID &>> $LOG_FILE"

# Copy files
execute_with_log "Copying /etc/group to $TAR_DIR/etc" "cp /etc/group $TAR_DIR/etc"
execute_with_log "Copying /etc/passwd to $TAR_DIR/etc" "cp /etc/passwd $TAR_DIR/etc"

log_message "TAR operations completed."

# Print information about jobs still running
log_message "The following jobs are still running in the background. Please check manually:"
jobs -l | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

log_message "Script execution completed successfully. Errors, if any, are logged in $ERROR_LOG."
log_message "Summary of created and copied files is available in $SUMMARY_FILE."
```

### Key Changes
1. **Summary File**:
   - Added `SUMMARY_FILE` to log successful operations.
2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Progress and error messages include timestamps.
   - Successful commands log details in both the main log and the summary file.
3. **Background Job Monitoring**:
   - Added information about background jobs still running.
4. **Readability**:
   - Clear messages for script progress and completion.

### Steps to Use:
1. Save the modified script as `your_script_name.sh`.
2. Execute it with the required `SID` argument:  
   ```bash
   ./your_script_name.sh <SID>
   ```
3. Check:
   - **`log_<hostname>_<timestamp>.log`** for detailed logs.
   - **`error_log_<hostname>_<timestamp>.log`** for errors.
   - **`summary_<hostname>_<timestamp>.log`** for a concise summary of successful operations.

This will ensure you have a detailed view of the operations and a quick summary of the completed actions.
