Year-End Summary: CBAC to AIMS Migration and Enhancements

This year, I focused on the successful migration from CBAC to AIMS, along with key application enhancements. Below is an overview of my contributions:
	1.	Analysis and Preparation for Migration:
	•	Conducted an in-depth analysis of the existing CBAC flow, including its hierarchy and user authentication mechanisms.
	•	Removed CBAC authentication and its hierarchy, aligning the system for AIMS integration.
	2.	AIMS Migration:
	•	Created AD groups in the non-production environment and began consuming AIMS esgroup header data.
	•	Analyzed and finalized AD groups to fit into the current model, ensuring seamless integration.
	•	Implemented changes to support critical functionalities, such as creating new BaR records, editing existing records, and copy-finalize functionality.
	3.	Application and Report Changes:
	•	Modified PDA reports to accommodate the new AIMS access groups and AD groups.
	•	Ensured that interfaces like RELMS, BAM, AFS, and OpMTrode were not impacted during the migration.
	•	Updated necessary database objects to support the migration.
	4.	Phase-2 Enhancements:
	•	Implemented functionality to move records from one AD group to another, ensuring database updates and audit logging for record transfers.
	•	Created an audit table to log record transfers, capturing details such as the source and destination AD groups.

Through these efforts, I ensured a smooth transition to AIMS while maintaining system integrity and enhancing functionality.
