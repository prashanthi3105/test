Year-End Summary: CBAC to AIMS Migration, AI/ML Initiatives, and Enhancements

This year, I contributed to several key initiatives, including system migrations, application enhancements, and AI/ML-focused projects. Below is an overview of my accomplishments:
	1.	CBAC to AIMS Migration:
	•	Conducted an in-depth analysis of the existing CBAC flow, including its hierarchy and user authentication mechanisms.
	•	Removed CBAC authentication and its hierarchy, aligning the system for AIMS integration.
	•	Created AD groups in the non-production environment and began consuming AIMS esgroup header data.
	•	Analyzed and finalized AD groups to fit into the current model, ensuring seamless integration.
	•	Implemented changes to support critical functionalities, such as creating new BaR records, editing existing records, and copy-finalize functionality.
	2.	Application and Report Changes:
	•	Modified PDA reports to accommodate the new AIMS access groups and AD groups.
	•	Ensured that interfaces like RELMS, BAM, AFS, and OpMTrode were not impacted during the migration.
	•	Updated necessary database objects to support the migration.
	3.	Phase-2 Enhancements:
	•	Implemented functionality to move records from one AD group to another, ensuring database updates and audit logging for record transfers.
	•	Created an audit table to log record transfers, capturing details such as the source and destination AD groups.
	4.	Fund Finance BQR Grid Changes:
	•	Worked extensively on Fund Finance BQR grid changes, addressing multiple rounds of requirement updates.
	•	Resolved issues where existing calculations did not meet standards by revising quantitative methods, calculation metrics, formula logic, and special rule messages.
	•	Delivered the updates successfully, ensuring alignment with all requirements.
	5.	Municipal Grid Updates:
	•	Addressed requirements to retain special rule calculations while suppressing messages, ensuring notes messages were reflected on the Analysis page and in PDA reports.
	•	Managed multiple rounds of requirement changes and, after thorough analysis, delivered the updates with zero issues.
	•	Conducted demos for the RRM team to showcase the implemented changes.
	6.	Reason Code Changes:
	•	Analyzed and designed the requirements for enabling sub-reason codes based on parent reason codes.
	•	Designed the solution to fit into the current ART structure by creating new tables to manage the parent and sub-reason dropdowns.
	•	Inserted all required data into the database and introduced necessary DB objects while modifying existing tables.
	7.	AD Group Research and Enhancements:
	•	Researched and implemented solutions for creating new AD groups and enabling/disabling AD groups as needed.
	8.	EFM Requirements – Top 3 Reasons Derivation:
	•	Recently worked on a new requirement in the EFM domain, understanding the needs through multiple calls with the business and EFM teams.
	•	Analyzed Python code provided by the EFM team for deriving the top 3 reasons and successfully converted it into Java.
	•	Delivered a solution to derive the top 3 reasons, exploring new areas beyond the standard BQR grid work.
	•	Found this opportunity exciting and a valuable learning experience, contributing new capabilities to ART.
	9.	AI/ML Initiatives and Achievements:
	•	Participated in an AI/ML hackathon and successfully reached the final round.
	•	Submitted a white paper on risk rating using AI/ML, which received very positive feedback from the respective teams.
	•	Participated in datathon, probathon, and puzzle competitions, showcasing problem-solving and analytical skills.
	•	Collaborated with the team to submit an AI impact form focusing on risk rating trend analysis using AI/ML.

Through these efforts, I ensured seamless migrations, robust enhancements, and significant contributions to AI/ML initiatives, maintaining high standards of quality and innovation.
