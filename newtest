**Problem Statement for a Credit Recommendations Engine:**

Consumers often face challenges in selecting the most suitable credit products due to a lack of personalized guidance, leading to suboptimal financial decisions. Without tailored recommendations, individuals may end up with credit options that don't align with their financial situation, credit history, or goals, resulting in higher interest rates, unfavorable terms, or missed opportunities for better financial management. 

An AI-powered credit recommendation engine can address this issue by analyzing a user's unique financial data, offering personalized, real-time recommendations. By assessing risk accurately, predicting future financial behavior, and continuously adapting to changes in the userâ€™s profile, the AI model ensures that users receive the most relevant and beneficial credit options, leading to more informed and optimal financial decisions.
